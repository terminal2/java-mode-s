Mode-S/ADS-B (Dump 1090) Java Library
======================================

This library decodes ADS-B Messages and creates an easy to work with track object.

## DF17/DF18 - Extended Squitter

DF17 is used for aircraft, while DF18 is used for other vessels (ground vehicles, static objects, ...)

Most features of the DF17/18 protocol have been implemented, some message lack support for specific fields.

## DF20/21 Comm-B

DF20/21 messages are replies to data requests from a radar station, you'll only receive these messages if Mode-S radar
is actively requesting this information. You will only receive messages requested by the radar.

Message is structured as follows:

```
LSB |1----|6--|9----|14----|20-----------|33------------------------------------------------------|89-----------------------|
    | DF  |FS | DR  |  UM  |     AC      |                         MB                             |            AP           |
MSB |----5|--8|---13|----19|-----------32|------------------------------------------------------88|----------------------112|

LSB: Least Significant Bit (First bit) (inclusive)
MSB: Most Significant bit (Last bit) (Inclusive)

DF: Downlink Format
FS: Flight Status
DR: Downlink Request
UM: Utitlity Message
AC: Altitude Code (DF20: Altitude | DF21: Mode-A Code)
MB: Comm-B Message
AP: Address / Parity (Mode-S Address + Parity check)
```


The system uses BDS (comm-B Data Selected) code to determine the requested information. The radar station will
send a request (UF20 / UF21) containing a reply ID. The reply ID is a used by the aircraft in the response. 
This means the reply by the aircraft does not contain the original BDS, without this info you have to guess which BDS is used.

You run through each BDS and pass the message to the decoder, if the message does not fit you assume it's not correct. 
Repeat this process until you have a match. 

At this moment the coded logic has too many incorrect matches and thus decided to disable BDS guessing.
We are actively looking for a fix, or at least the ability to enable this with an experimental flag.
We hope with more BDS implemented the guessing accuracy will improve.

# Installation 

This package is available through Maven Central

Pom
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>aero.t2s</groupId>
  <artifactId>mode-s</artifactId>
  <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle
```
 compile('aero.t2s:mode-s:0.2.0-SNAPSHOT')
```

# Usage

```java
class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ModeS modes = new ModeS("127.0.0.1", 30002, 52.0, 0.0);

        modes.onTrackCreated(track -> System.out.println("CREATED " + track.toString()));
        modes.onTrackUpdated(track -> System.out.println("UPDATED " + track.toString()));
        modes.onTrackDeleted(track -> System.out.println("DELETED " + track.toString()));

        // Get decoded Downlink messages
        modes.onMessage(message -> System.out.println("MESSAGE " + message.getClass().getSimpleName()));
        
        // Starts listening thread
        modes.start();
   
        // Get all tracks Map<String, Track>
        modes.getTracks();
    
        // Stop listening
        modes.stop();
    }
}
```

## Using Aircraft Database

This library is compatible with [OpenSky dataset](https://opensky-network.org/datasets/metadata/).

In order to use the database version you can start ModeS plugin as follows:

```java
class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ModeSDatabase database = new ModeSDatabase(Path.of("./doc8643AircraftTypes.csv"), Path.of("./aircraftDatabase.csv"))
        ModeS modes = new ModeS("127.0.0.1", 30002, 52.0, 0.0);
    }
}
```

## DF Messages only

If you don't need or want to use the track management feature you can also use this library without it.

```java
class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        ModeSMessageHandler handler = new ModeSMessageHandler(52.0, 0.0);
        handler.onMessage((df) -> System.out.println(message.getClass().getSimpleName()));
        ModeS modes = new ModeS("127.0.0.1", 30002, handler);
    }
}
```
